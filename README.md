`Proxima Centauri, the closest star to planet Earth, is at least 40,208,000,000,000 kilometres away, 4.24 light-years away, a light-year is 9.44 trillion kilometres or 5.88 trillion miles, a light-year is a distance that light travels in a vacuum in one Julian year (365.242222 days), if a normal human wants to reach the closest star from planet Earth by walking, it would take at least 215 million years. No matter how far it is, there is living creature high up there because Allah's Throne is upon water [11:7], water is the source of life [2:164],[6:164],[10:24],[14:32],[16:10],[16:11],[16:65],[20:53],[2:30],[22:5],[22:63],[24:45],[25:49],[25:54],[27:60],[29:63],[30:24],[30:50],[31:10],[32:27],[35:27],[39:21],[41:39],[43:11],[50:9], there are 8 angels bear the Throne at its edges [69:17], space exploration also means Heaven exploration [69:16], Heaven or السَّمَاء means "very high up in the sky". There is one and only way to reach that Throne very high up in the sky, just keep on working hard, working hard, working hard, never stop working hard, just keep on working hard to stay alive, do not just try to be a normal human, be a superhuman, be a superpower, go الأَقۡصَي, "Aqsa"; go farthermost, go extreme, to the highest degree, to the utmost degree, push it to the limit [17:1], just keep on building very clear and clean ٱلصِّرَاطَ, "ṣirāṭ"; direction, command, movement, passage, path [1:6],[1:7] properly, as the perfect سَبِيلَ, "sabil"; way, access, channel, road, route, track, medium, path [7:142] to reach the level of Most High, the Most Great [2:255]. Do not ever listen to, do not ever pay attention to the naysayers [144:4], do not waste your precious time, always be punctual [103:1],[103:2],[103:3], understand every work flow, route, movement, activity, interest, influence [21:33], test every single of them; maximum, highest, hardest, heaviest, evil, harsh working condition and minimum, lowest, softest, lightest, good, easy working condition; find the main root cause, main source of the truth [21:34],[21:35], only listen, only pay attention to the people who; consistent, standing firm, always stay true to his or her own words [5:41], only believe, full faith, put trust in the one who does [2:30], remember properly all the names who can show the truth, only learn, gain information, collect intelligence from them [2:31], honour and respect their good, real, full, precise, actual; name, rank, position, hierarchy, position [49:11],[49:12], assume them as family members; learn all of their distinctive traits, characteristics, qualities; collect, organize, analyse, interpret, explain, present all their respective values; know properly every single of them; knowledge, skills, abilities; way, procedure, method on how they perform their task, role [49:13]; it's a state of mind; روح, "rūḥ"; spirit, soul, mental; that is الۡقُدُسِ, "Al-Quds"; holy, pure, perfect, flawless, clear, whole, dedicated; can make anything well, alive [5:110], a true master of everything [38:72], nothing is impossible, everything is possible [2:117],[3:47],[3:59],[6:73],[16:40],[19:35],[36:82],[40:68]. A sign of kingship, that you already reached that kind of level is that the Ark of the Covenant will come to you, also carried by the angels [2:248], and the Heaven will split [69:16] ( meaning the Heaven is fully open for you as the sign of your true kingship, welcoming you to sit on ) the Throne [69:17], achieved the quality or state of being tranquil; that is, complete calm, complete serene, complete worry-free, and your army, troops, soldiers will consist of those coming from heavens, "very high up in the sky", and from the Earth; forces of the Heavens and the Earth [48:4].`

**_Currently, there are only 2 space forces on planet Earth, really serious to explore the Heavens, very high up in the sky;_** <br />
**_1) Russian Space Forces, Космические войска России [ Russian Federation ]; started in year 1992, initial project started in year 1955 under the name; Space Operations Section, Strategic Operations Branch of the Supreme High Command Reserve Artillery, Секции космических операций, стратегических операций отделения ВГК резервной артиллерии_** <br />
**_2) United States Space Force [ United States of America ]; started in year 2019, initial project started in year 1982 under the name; Air Force Space Command_** <br />

* Intelligence word comes from Latin intelligentia (“the act of choosing between, intelligence”), from intellegō (“understand”), from inter (“between”) + legō (“choose, pick out, read”), capacity of mind, especially to understand principles, truths, facts or meanings, acquire knowledge, and apply it to practice; the ability to comprehend and learn, is an important component of national power and a fundamental element in decision making regarding national security, defense, and foreign policies. There are 133 stars carved into the white Alabama marble wall, each one representing an employee who died in the line of service for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),  a civilian foreign intelligence service of the federal government of the United States of America.

# Brief introduction about GitHub and Microsoft
*** **GitHub, Inc.** owned by **Microsoft Corporation**, both from United States of America <br />
*** **Microsoft Corporation** founded by `William Henry Gates III` and `Paul Gardner Allen` <br />
*** `William Henry Gates III` working at least 16 hours every single day, sometimes can go to more than 36 hours non-stop, he even sleep under his office table until his work fully finish ( Latin : aut coepisse noli aut confice | English : accomplish or do not begin ) <br />
*** `Paul Gardner Allen` appreciates everything he can get, reach near him, even though it is just a piece of garbage left by others to teach his beloved student, `William Henry Gates III` on how to do proper coding, proper comprehension of programming language concept in the world of computer science <br />
*** In United States of America and in the world of computer science, nothing is really impossible if you really believe you can do it and you really believe that you can hit your objective, mission and vision you want to achieve in your lifetime <br />
*** What you do right now, what you really believe in right now, what you work so hard to accomplish right now will define what you will become in the future, just do your work, just do your job, just do it, just keep on moving, just finish it !!! <br />
```
If you can't FLY
  Then RUN,
If you can't RUN 
  Then WALK, 
If you can't WALK 
  Then CRAWL, 
  
Whatever you do :
{ you have to KEEP MOVING FORWARD. }
{ you have to HIT THE FINISH LINE. }
```

# Brief introduction about my computer science journey
It all started when I saw a presentation about **dinosaur** on a computer, currently United States of America (USA) boasts the greatest number of dinosaur species found on planet Earth, maybe this is why, currently United States of America (USA) is the main leader in the world of computer science, and then I found **dinosaur** again, especially in the Operating System Concepts textbook used by the university to study about the world of computer science, which is also stated on that textbook `printed in the United States of America`. What I can understand right now is that American people built their computer and the operating system to fully understand the dinosaur they found in their new-found world, which is right now being renamed the Jurassic World.. **RAWR !!!**

## 42. Benchmark
*** `Abu Abdullah Mālik ibn Anas ibn Mālik Ibn Abī 'Āmir Ibn 'Amr Ibnul-Hārith Ibn Ghaimān Ibn Khuthail Ibn 'Amr Ibnul-Haarith`,
reverently known as `Imam Mālik`, the grand teacher of `Muhammad bin Idris bin Al-Abbas bin Usman bin Syafie bin As-Saib`, reverently known as `Imam Syafi'i` or `Imam Syafie`.  <br />
*** `Imam Mālik` learned from **at least 900 teachers** to write a book known as **Muwaṭṭaʾ** which means **"well-trodden path"**, hailed as **_"the soundest book on earth after the Quran"_** by `Imam Syafi'i`, the compilation of the **Muwaṭṭaʾ** led to `Imam Mālik` being bestowed with such reverential epithets as Proof of the Community, Imam of the Abode of Emigration, and Knowledgeable Scholar of Medina.  <br />
*** Malik, Melik, Malka, Malek, Malick, or Melekh (Phoenician: 𐤌𐤋𐤊; Arabic: ملك‎; Hebrew: מֶלֶךְ) is the Semitic term translating to **king**, recorded in East Semitic and later Northwest Semitic (e.g. Aramaic, Canaanite, Hebrew) and Arabic. It is also one of the Names of Allah in the Qur'an, and is then al-Malik (الملك) or **The King**, **Lord of the Worlds** in the absolute sense (denoted by the definite article), meaning the **King of Kings**, above all earthly rulers.
  <br />
*** Some of kingdoms on this planet Earth ruled by a Malik (currently and historically) :  <br />
1) Afghanistan  <br />
2) Armenia <br />
3) Bahrain  <br />
4) Bangladesh  <br />
5) Egypt  <br />
6) Georgia  <br />
7) India  <br />
8) Iraq  <br />
9) Jordan  <br />
10) Libya  <br />
11) Maldives  <br />
12) Morocco  <br />
13) Oman  <br />
14) Pakistan  <br />
15) Saudi Arabia  <br />
